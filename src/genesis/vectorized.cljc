(ns genesis.vectorized
  "CPU-side vectorized Cartpole simulator.

  Bit-for-bit reference implementation of `resources/genesis/wgsl/cartpole_step.wgsl`.
  The WGSL kernel runs one env per global invocation; `step-vectorized`
  steps N envs in a tight loop using the same formulas.

  The wgpu `ComputePipeline` dispatch machinery that would run this WGSL on
  a GPU (`kami-genesis/src/wgpu_backend.rs`) is NOT ported — it has no
  meaningful CLJC representation (a real device/queue/compute-pass binding
  is native-only). The WGSL source string itself, however, IS portable data
  (it was `include_str!`'d in the original Rust) and is embedded here as
  `wgsl-source`.

  Restored from kotoba-lang/kami-engine `kami-genesis/src/vectorized.rs`
  (deleted PR #82) as zero-dependency portable CLJC. Per ADR-2607010930.
  Ported 1:1 (fully portable pure math/data)."
